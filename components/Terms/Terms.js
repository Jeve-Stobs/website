        <h2>Changes to these Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. For instance,
          we may need to change these Terms if we come out with a new feature or
          for some other reason. <br /> Whenever we make changes to these Terms,
          the changes are effective 24-hours after we post such revised Terms
          (indicated by revising the date at the top of these Terms) or upon
          your acceptance if we provide a mechanism for your immediate
          acceptance of the revised Terms (such as a click-through confirmation
          or acceptance button). It is your responsibility to check Acoustic for
          changes to these Terms. <br /> If you continue to use the Service
          after the revised Terms go into effect, then you have accepted the
          changes to these Terms.
